Here you will find assembly, programming, and 3D part (*.STL) files for the ManderMeter, a handheld sensor I developed for our ongoing research on salamander ecology and physiology. The device has onboard air temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature sensors. 


# Taking Readings
After turning the device on, it will run through the program and provide initial sensor readings. To take a new set of readings, press the front-facing button.
